        <h2>Tech Colonialism today and my vision for the year to come.</h2>
        <p>
            As I was reading this article, I began to reflect on the global issues of today; 
            the wars around the world, tech leaders acting more like oligarchs and the growing impact of nationalism on the rise. 
            It reminds of how colonialism has never left, just changed its form. 
            More people are trying to maintain their power and status by any means necessary, 
            even if it means creating a divided world where they can choose to disseminate truths of lies to the common people.

            Sareeta Amrute highlights that “a colonial relationship is hierarchical, extractive and exploitative” and a small group of these people see themselves as the techno chauvinists of the world, deserving the right and authority to dictate our live for their benefit. Not only has that caused me to be shaken at the prospect of consistently being watched and monitored by someone far away, but it also makes me sad that people are willing or expense freedom with comfort or truth with deception, polarizing the view of the world to the whim of technocrats.

            What I also find interesting is how exclusionary these groups can be, especially from voices that are their own race or gender. This has shown me they use technology to not only show people what they want you to see but also suppress voices that show the truth, regardless of how painful it can be, the concept of shadow banning comes to mind whereby you may say something that is true, but the algorithm would deem your comment “too sensitive” or “not relevant to address to others” making it harder for your comment to be take lower priority on a persons feed and therefore dismissing the issue entirely; while I agree there are instances where this can be used for good, most of the time it has been as a means to cover up global injustices and dissuade people from find the truth.

            With all my concern, I am however glad that this has been foreseen. Sareeta cited from Frantz Fanon “the colonial system, in fact, was only interested in certain riches…” and how we should reshape our thinking towards making the unseen, seen. I also love the idea of collective action; her use of radicalising ethics, joining movements, practicing refusal and extending to others provides better framework for myself when having these conversations with others and coming to terms with understanding the truth.

            Overall, Sareeta has provided me a hope for a better future. During this year I hope I can make a difference by practicing reshaping my thinking and express my opinion without fear or shame. What I also hope for this year is to use this opportunity to reinvent my self when it comes to how I view technology, and it uses in my home and community. Though there is a looming threat another cold war between some global powerhouses, the thought shouldn’t be how to compete with them, but rather how can I learn from them and use the information to benefit the country, because at the end of the day competing means nothing if I don’t try my best my home and country for the better, not matter how big or my ambitions may be.
