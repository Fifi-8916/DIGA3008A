                        Sheena Magenya has proven a point of how the internet still reflects the ideologies of the past. 
                        As an African woman, it has been prevalent that we focus on innovating for the benefit of the community, 
                        rather than for personal enjoyment and satisfaction. While I agree that the former is still very important, 
                        I think that we should be open to allow opportunities for diverse communities to thrive in the technological 
                        space such as artist expression and creativity. Art has become a fundamental aspect in the subversion of norms 
                        and the expression of cultural values, making it important to use in raising awareness and express discontent in 
                        healthy environments. Allowing art to thrive is to allow, the way we do thinks have more colour in our painting of 
                        life, though it's messy, it shows the imperfections in that need to be addressed.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        I also find it admirable that she points out the lack of legislation that encourages change in the to how we 
                        gain access to the internet and how we navigate it. The internet has demostrated bias towards those that control 
                        the system itself, for obvious reasons, and has discrimanted the others, even when those people try to demonstrate 
                        prowess through their goodwill and generosity; what Africa needs is a fair chance, not be a charity for those in power. 
                        Sheena points that out in the articles that Africa has been more of a testing ground for pharmaceuticals, which leaves 
                        more Africans left in the dust due to health complications and side effects of medical culture. 
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                        African women would tip the scales to make the internet a more fair and just place. Opening the continent to becoming 
                        innovators and hearing our opinion, opens the door to true reconciliation of past and a step forward towards a better future. 
                        Though it's not going to be, I believe that we are constantly closing the gap to a better future.
