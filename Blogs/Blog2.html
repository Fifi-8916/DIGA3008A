                    I recently completed my GitHub setup and now can work in Visual Studio Code. 
                    Though I had some trouble connecting the codespace to the Visual Studio Code, 
                    I eventually got there. Currently, I have started working on small tutorials, 
                    particularly MDN Web Docs, to help me in my HTML journey. The image before shows
                     what I have been able to display using the weblink over the weekend.

                    For my wireframe, I’m aiming to add the basic concepts, some text, 
                    as both titles and body text for the blog, images and interactive 
                    component like a sidebar. The file structure currently has the following 
                    folders: blogs images, scripts and styles, but everything is subject to 
                    change and update as time progresses; I’m thinking about separating the 
                    preface of the blog with the actual blog so that my blog folder doesn’t 
                    end up too full and wordy. I’m using https://wireframe.cc/ to design my 
                    website as shown in Wireframe 1. After a bit of looking into wireframe, 
                    I had discovered that there were more options compared to the original 
                    options, particularly the sections options, which provided me with more 
                    elaborate options that combines smaller components into a larger framework. 
                    This helps me have a better understanding of website frameworks and how 
                    each section would be sorted out and structured. This is demonstrated in 
                    my second iterating in image 2.

                    My hope for this week is to align my texts and images such that they look 
                    like Image 1, that way I have confidence in building a basic website and 
                    hopefully by the end of the week work to making my website akin to Image 2, 
                    more polished and refined section where the whole blog isn’t in the main 
                    page but if prefaced and lead to the blog in a new page. I have a lot to do.
