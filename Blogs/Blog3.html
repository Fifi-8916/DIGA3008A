                    I’ve been able to make a lot of progress in terms of core programming, 
                    I now have 3 pages, home, blog and gallery. I have also created a navigation 
                    bar on the home page and now I’m able to move to the other two pages, 
                    not back yet, but since the initial navigation bar is working fine, 
                    I’m more confident that other will work well. This week I’m planning 
                    to finish the navigation bar for all pages, add extra pages containing 
                    personal information and project showcases and add all the missing information 
                    that I’m going to be written. So, this week I’m hoping to complete the barebones of the website.

                    In terms of design, I’m thinking of making use of the hover feature to reveal 
                    information about myself on the home page and display details about the pages 
                    before the user can click on the page. I’ve made 3rd major iteration, but I 
                    think this will be my final major change. I wanted to create a more whimsy 
                    element to my website, hence the use of the hover feature. I’m hoping that 
                    it will create a create and artistic idea of what I have in mind, but I’ll 
                    have to first get through the basic stuff before I get to this.
