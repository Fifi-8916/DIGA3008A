                    I have made a lot of progress this week. Started making use of micro 
                    formatting for some minor elements such sections and article for organising, 
                    hr lines to help make sure my sentences are in the writes lines and an early 
                    aside function for future use in when styling in CSS. Speaking of CSS, if I 
                    was understanding correctly, <code>div</code> and <code>span</code> are used to as containers that 
                    help with styling for CSS, so it makes sense why we would be hammered to not 
                    use <code>div</code> and <code>span</code>. What is also interesting is the use of attributes to either 
                    reference, classify and identify certain portions of the script, praying this 
                    makes it easier in CSS and JavaScript; it has helped me in small features that 
                    make my website more interactable.

                    Overall, my website, though very repetitive provides me with the basic outline, 
                    I’m able to move to and from different pages and I hope this week to add all my 
                    basic information for the website. In terms of design, I’ve made designs for all 
                    my pages with basic wireframing, this helped me order my website design formatting, 
                    I would’ve been stuck if I didn’t do that. Praying that God helps me in this endeavour 
                    and that nothing bad will happen…hopefully.
