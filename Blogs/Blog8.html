                        In the midst of the COVID process, many have seen the growth of technology and the need for it in our everyday lives. 
                        Global interconnectivity has allowed us as a society to expand our personal worldview as individuals and make use of these 
                        resources to thrive in life. However, not all societies have the means to these resources and have therefore struggled, 
                        especially since we are moving to become a more technologically incorporated society. The lack of a just transitional phase 
                        towards technological advancement has widened the digital divide even further as research in technological advancement does 
                        not try to tech others how to use technology rather we use their methods and processes as a solution instead of critically 
                        analyze and interpret that information to benefit their own communities. We all have a write to the internet and use it to 
                        learn and grow, but we must also learn the skills to navigate this new challenge of misinformation and lies in our searches. 
                        Through initiatives such as Project Isizwe and The Good Work foundation, there is a hope to shrink the digital divide and provide 
                        easily accessible internet to rural communities opening that door to more opportunities to them and their societies.
