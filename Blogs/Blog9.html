                            In Spyros Kasapis' article Internet Access being a fundamental right, 
                            he talks about the Internet becoming a human right or as a medium to facilitate 
                            human rights and how the global pandemic changed the way we perceive and receive 
                            information in the broad spectrum, as many are witness now, Western Civilizations views on human rights and justice, 
                            may not always align with everyone as a whole, particularly those who are/were disenfranchised by those western civilizations. 
                            This was evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, where some countries were able to make this transition swiftly and easily, 
                            others had very little access to the internet and therefore many lost their livelihoods to the crisis, 
                            creating devastation and irreversible harm to many communities. 
                        
                        </p>
                        </br>
                        <p>
                            His fundamental argument about the internet being a fundamental right 
                            is because of Salvador Allende's comment that happiness is a human right, 
                            though I argue fulfillment would be a better phrase than happiness, 
                            the point still stands; the internet has grown to such an extent that it 
                            has become a part of our lives. This powerful tool has opened us to endless 
                            amounts of information in your fingertips and has allowed use to raise awareness 
                            about actual social issues and advocacy efforts (Phoshoko, 2023). However, this 
                            has opened the door to digital inequalities where many don't have access to these technologies, 
                            due to lack of policy and infrastructure/funding to the creation of these technologies and even 
                            in worst cases and provided with false information and obfuscations of the truth that lead people 
                            to more reactionary sentiment. 
                        
                        </p>
                        </br>
                        <p>
                            He concludes with a few questions on potential steps that could lead to a more fair and 
                            digitally democratic society. In order policies should be implemented and adopted to incorporate 
                            those in less advantaged areas and give the opportunities for sector to lower barrier of entry to use 
                            these technologies and create more initiatives to educate others in the use of the systems (McNulty, 2024). 
                            South Africa with it's SA Connect policy has helped in reducing the divide by providing broadband network 
                            to those underserved throughout the country (SA Connect, n.d.). 

                        </p>
                        </br>
                        <p>
                            In conclusion, though I argue that are we still a while from calling the Internet a human right, 
                            we are making active steps to make this a reality and though we are using the internet as a medium, 
                            we recognise the importance of using technology to benefit the greater society. Overall, by taking 
                            steps in the right direction, we become more aligned r goals and hope to see this statement as a reality.
