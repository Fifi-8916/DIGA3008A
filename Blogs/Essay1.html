                        In the world of trading card games (TCG), building a deck of your own requires time, consider and apt
                        budgeting. The best advice to provide when building a new deck is to buy single cards, they can be
                        much cheaper and less reliant on luck. This has created an opportunity for your local game store
                        (LGS) to sell those singles of these cards on their store websites, as an easier and local way to
                        streamline to shop for these cards. While this has made things easier, this has opened a potential
                        problem, there are many singles that can be sold to you with varying prices ranges and requirements,
                        making it overwhelming to the user. Thankfully, using filters this has helped; however, from personal
                        experience, the lack of an advance filter has made decision making and searching for cards much
                        more complicated.
                    </p>
                        </br>
                    <p>
                        This does not just apply to card singles but any thing that has a vast array of items that they sell
                        regularly and requires upkeep and management of inventory, such as clothing and cosmetics.
                        Advanced filtering creates a more robust and thought-out system that highlights key characteristic of
                        an item and sorts them based on set tags and colour identifiers, creating intuitive design and more
                        control for the user <i>(Vassilatos and Crawshaw, 2023)</i>. By analysing the design and user flow of the
                        website, Top Deck, we could find potential solutions that can improve this feature in making a more
                        robust and thoughtful system for anyone to make use of.
                    </p>                      
                        </br>
                    <p>
                        When considering Hick’s law, the goal is to simplify the number of choices that the user makes allows
                        the users to make more informed decisions. Filtering can assist this through grouping via high-level
                        categories, where “the highest level is put on navigation” <i>(Manabie Tech-Product Blog, 2020)</i> such as
                        the set these cards are coming and grouping that into subcategories such as card type and colour.
                        Top deck demonstrates a better understanding of Hick’s law as at the highest level it has the
                        categories of each released set that is readily available in the store and once you’ve selected a set,
                        there is a filter system that filters via colour rarity, card type and price, making the decision-making
                        process accessible and readable. Though I would like minor adjustments, such as improving on
                        colour categorising, some cards may have more than one colour, the concept is there and provides a
                        way to filter the cards a robust manner.
                    </p>
                        </br>
                    <p>
                        Thought the website a robust system for its main card game, Magic the gathering, everything else
                        within the site is not as robust. The biggest culprit is their board game section. The design, though
                        consistent in its styling, lacks the organised categories that the cards have and, in some cases, use
                        filters that would not be easy for the user to understand immediately such game mechanics. Going
                        through the list of categories you would find about over 60 categories and about 70 mechanics to
                        pick from, this defeats Hick’s law as the categories and mechanics are too broad in their thought
                        process. It could that the designers thought it would be better to organise through these systems in
                        this way because the user would be able to find what they are looking like that. However, this creates
                        a situation where themes have been confused with categories. Categories are “a collection of similar
                        data sorted into the same place” <i>(Morse, 2008)</i>, whereas themes are “the meaningful ‘essence’ that
                        runs through the data” <i>(Morse, 2008)</i>. With that in mind it would have been better to categories
                        board games via series titles or company name, making the categories accessible for everyone.
                    </p>
                        </br>
                    <p>
                        The greatest concern on the website is the lack of sorting when content is filtered. By default, the
                        cards are sorted highest to lowest, but the highest selling card is seen in the second row of the first
                        section. The reason could be that the website could be organising the cards based on the original
                        non-foil card then to its other variants in the set, but that would be too taxing on the user for there is
                        a variety of the same product. This leads to comparative bias, essential details of the card are smaller
                        than the card itself, encouraging you to pick the more expensive option due to design alone. A
                        solution this is remove the variants from the initial grid and instead have them as options when you
                        investigate more detail of the card, giving the user a better understanding of what they are getting
                        Sand their respective prices.

                    <p>
                        Overall, through the viewing of the design of filters have shown a few things: advanced filtering
                        requires more queries that are the user can easily understand and keep track of in case they want to
                        make changes. With that we can turn to the use of a sidebar navigator, it is much more scalable and
                        allows to nest multiple categories vertically to filter the entire system to the user’s needs. This helps
                        with the scalability problem though this falls flat when not every item needs to be sorted out this
                        way <i>(Vassilatos and Crawshaw, 2023)</i>. The unity asset store is a notable example of the sidebar as
                        there are a wide variety of assets used to make a game and by filtering, the user will have an easier
                        time finding that they are looking for.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In conclusion, Local game stores demand a lot out the user to understand what they want before
                        they make their choice, but we have also that they could display too much information to the user at
                        once, making the user got through pages of variants instead of a single page of what you need.
                        Refining these websites, requires modification and time to figure out the main categories and the sub-categories as well as highlight the most readily available card with the least, so that the user
                        makes a well-informed from with any fatigue clouding their judgement.
