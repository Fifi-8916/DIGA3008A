                    I want you to enter my dream world, the vastness of my creativity and ingenuity
                     brought to light. I am often a day dreamer so I think it would be better to show 
                     off what I think than to just explain it all to you. I hope you were able to find 
                     my puzzle. It shouldn't be hard just call me when you have an answer. By the way, 
                     this isn't me being crazy, I just want to speak my thoughts the best way I can. 
                     So I hope you're enjoying the experience. :)
