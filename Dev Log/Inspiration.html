                    I was inspired by the beauty of the night sky. Sometimes when I look up at night, 
                    I wander and look at the sky with the stars shinning bright, this was especially 
                    when I was younger. I like the idea of drifting off into a dream world where you 
                    can anything you want to be. This is actually one of the main reasons why I like 
                    games and want to make them. Getting back on topic, I thought why can't I make this 
                    website about that aspect of me, a dreamer and try and make some of my dreams reality.
