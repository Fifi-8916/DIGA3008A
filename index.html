        <p>I recently completed my GitHub setup and now can work in Visual Studio Code. Though I had some trouble connecting the codespace to the Visual Studio Code, I eventually got there. Currently, I have started working on small tutorials, particularly MDN Web Docs, to help me in my HTML journey. The image before shows what I have been able to display using the weblink over the weekend.</p>
